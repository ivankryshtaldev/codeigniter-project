            </h1>
            <h5> Last Updated: Sept. 2019 </h5>

            At Hostbot.uk we consider the privacy of our visitors, and the security of their personal information, to be extremely important. This Privacy Policy document describes, in detail, the types of personal information we collect and record at Hostbot.uk, and how we use this information.
            <h3>LOG FILES</h3>
            <br>
            Like many other Web sites, Hostbot.uk makes use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies, and a part of hosting services's analytics. The information inside the log files includes: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and in some cases, the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movement around the site, and to gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information, are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.  <br><br>

            <h3>COLLECTING INFORMATION</h3>
            <h4>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h4>

            What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place between you and Hostbot, most of which can be categorized under the following:  <br><br>

            <b>Using Hostbot Software as a Service.</b> When you use any Hostbot Software as a Service, we store all the content you provide, including but not limited to accounts created for team members, files, pictures, project information, and any other information that you provide to the services you use. <br><br>

            For any Hostbot Software as a Service, we also collect data about usage of the software. This may include, but is not limited to, numbers of users, flows, broadcasts etc. <br><br>

            <b>Types of Personal Information: </b> <br><br>
            (i) Users: identification, publicly available social media profile information, e-mail, IT information (IP addresses, usage data, cookies data, browser data); financial information (credit card details, account details, payment information).<br><br>
            (ii) Subscribers: identification and publicly available social media profile information (name, date of birth, gender, geographic location), chat history, navigational data (including chatbot usage information), application integration data, and other electronic data submitted, stored, sent, or received by end users and other personal information, the extent of which is determined and controlled by the Customer in its sole discretion. <br><br>

            <b>Purchasing Hostbot PRO subscription.</b> When you sign up for Hostbot Software as a Service PRO Subscription, we collect information to process your payment and create your customer account. This information includes name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and company name where applicable. We retain the last four digits of your credit card to allow you to identify the card used for future purchases. We use a third-party service provider to process your credit card transactions. These third parties are governed by their own agreements.<br><br>

            <b>User generated content.</b> Our products and services often give you the option to provide feedback, such as suggestions, compliments or problems encountered. We invite you to provide such feedback as well as to participate with comments on our blog and community page. If you choose to post a comment, your user name, city, and any other information that you choose to post will be visible to the public. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information that you choose to post to our website, including in our blogs, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. Any information that you disclose becomes public information. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy. <br><br>

            <b>Data collected for and by our Users.</b> As you use our Services, you may import into our system personal information you have collected from your Subscribers or other individuals.

As part of our Services, we may use and incorporate into features information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have collected about Subscribers. <br><br>

            If you are a Subscriber and no longer want to be contacted by one of our users, please unsubscribe directly from that user’s bot or contact the user directly to update or delete your data.<br><br>

            <b>Information automatically collected.</b> Our servers may automatically record certain information about how you use our Site (we refer to this information as "Log Data"), including both Clients and casual visitors.

We use this information to administer the Service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Service by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences. <br><br>

            <b>Sensitive personal information.</b> Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send or disclose to us any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or union membership) on or through the Service or otherwise. <br><br>

            If you send or disclose any sensitive personal information to us (such as when you submit user generated content to the Site), you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not provide it.
